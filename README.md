This repository sets up my shell environment the way I like it.  This includes 
the following:

- Installing packages (for Arch).
- Setting up python.
- Installing shell scripts.
- Configuring programs via rc files and environment variables.
- Setting up aliases.

Install using the following command:
```
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kalekundert/rc/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```
