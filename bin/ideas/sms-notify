I can send text messages to myself using verizon's SMS gateway service.
The wikipedia article titled "List of SMS Gateways" has useful
information about this.

The procedure is simple.  Just send an email to <6508148603@vtext.com>.
The subject line will be put in parentheses and prepended to the
message.  This method can be completely automated.

Interestingly, verizon offers a web interface to this service which
cannot be automated because it requires a captcha.  This doesn't make
sense to me, since it's probably even easier to automate email:

crontab -e 
* * * * * * mail ----------@vtext.com
