# The fmask flag turns off the executable bit for any files in the mounted 
# filesystem.  Without this, every file seems to be executable (maybe that's 
# a limitation of the vfat filesystem?).  So this is nice, because it means 
# that I don't need to `chmod a-x` everything I copy off the usb drive.
